Performed ANN on Churn_Modelling.csv . Trained the data whether a person with creditcard score , gender , age  , salary etc will leave the bank or not . Attained 86 percentage accuracy .

# STEPS IN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK 

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Encoding categorical data

-> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

-> Feature Scaling

-> Building the ANN

-> Training the ANN

-> Training the ANN on the Training set

-> Making the predictions and evaluating the model

-> Predicting the Test set results

-> Making the Confusion Matrix
